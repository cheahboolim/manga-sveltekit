I need you to save the image you uploaded to this location. Since I cannot directly handle binary files, please:

1. Save the uploaded image as "meme-coin-poll.jpg" in the "static/ads/" folder
2. Then I'll update the component to use the local path

The image should be saved as:
static/ads/meme-coin-poll.jpg
