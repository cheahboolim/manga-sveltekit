I need you to save the uploaded gambling ad image to this location. Since I cannot directly handle binary files, please:

1. Save the uploaded image as "ggbet-bonus.jpg" in the "static/ads/" folder
2. Then the component will use the local path

The image should be saved as:
static/ads/ggbet-bonus.jpg
